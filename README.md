# Omicron
Python Webkit Browser

Will require the PyQt5 python module to run.
Run it normally: python omicron.py


It may have problems loading some sites, resulting in a crash and that's why i have checked further development of it in prospects of making it better by adopting the wxPython GUI framework and not PyQt5 anymore.

You may now check its better version of wxPython in my repository Quasar
